# Interactive Canvas Projects Gallery

A collection of interactive canvas-based animations and physics simulations built with vanilla JavaScript. Each project demonstrates different aspects of HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript programming.

## 🎨 Projects

### 1. Gravity Simulation
An interactive physics simulation featuring multiple balls affected by gravity and bounce mechanics.
- Multiple bouncing balls with realistic physics
- Ground collision detection
- Adjustable gravity and bounce parameters

### 2. Spider Web Effect
A mesmerizing interactive web-like effect that responds to mouse movement.
- Dynamic line connections
- Mouse-based interaction
- Grid-based point system
- White on black aesthetic

### 3. Interactive Circles
Colorful circles that respond to mouse movement with smooth animations.
- Dynamic color patterns
- Size-based mouse interaction
- Smooth movement animations
- Collision detection with boundaries

### 4. Collision System
A physics-based particle system demonstrating elastic collisions between multiple objects.
- Realistic particle collisions
- Velocity-based movement
- Colorful particle borders
- Mouse interaction capabilities
